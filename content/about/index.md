I have been wanting, for years, to publish a collection of the various repairs I have done; if only for me to find them again when the time to upgrade the repair comes; or if the repair eventually fails, or if the item breaks again, differently. At the very least, by documenting how to properly disassemble the items we repair, what can break in the process, what was hidden, etc; we hope to minimize any subsequent hardships.
