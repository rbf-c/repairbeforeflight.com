I finally made this website
===========================

I have been meaning to do a website for logging all the maintenance and repair
works I do for a while now. Several years at least. It was never the right
time, it was never the right way, etc, etc.

Yesterday, I got this [new coffee grinder](https://link-to-come/) off of "Le
bon coin" (the French equivalent of Craigslist), and given how typical of an
experience it has been so far, I decided now was the perfect time to finally do
progress on this "project". So I can start with a textbook example of what
generally happens, from start (even if I will be missing a the photos of the
"before" state, I can at least describe and give examples of similar states I
find online), to finish.

The general idea is that I try my best to buy second hand items and goods, and
never trash any of my broken possessions without first trying to fix them (I
either keep the functional ones, sell them or give them away, of course. I am
not going to trash functional hardware if I try my best to salvage broken
ones). 

And often, I now succeed at fixing it (that took me a few years). But I either
regretted not sharing my notes, for eventual like-minded people to save time,
effort, and save them the mistakes I did; or I find myself wishing I had taken
said notes for future reference (I often have to open the items again to clean
them, or it also can happen that they break again).

So, now, I finally have a place where I can share posts of my repairs, from
start to finish, with a little bit of a background story, and a complete log of
all the steps from start to finish. Let's goooooo!
